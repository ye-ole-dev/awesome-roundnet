> A curated list of awesome roundnet stuff

## Why does it exist?

I wanted to keep up with the development of the Sport Roundnet and wanted to have a list of all kind of online available resources. So I can find the most important updates, discussions, trends, announcements from all sources involved in the development of the Sport.
I started it privately and figured: This might be useful for other people as well. So: Here we are!

## FAQ

### Can I add to the list?

Sure! You're more than welcome!
